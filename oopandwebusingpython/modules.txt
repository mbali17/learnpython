Modules are code that has been written by others and has been open sourced to 
be re-used by others.There are different ways of installing the modules but, the standard
way is to use pip.
to install a module using pip we can follow the syntax
	pip install module_name
well, you might run into 'pip' is not a recognised command and you would need to check if 
the variable has the entry for the pip program.
