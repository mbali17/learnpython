#Strings can use double quotes or single quote
print("Hello World")
print('Hello World')

#String concatenation using either '+' or ","
print("Hello"+"World")
#this way adds space after each concatenation i,e after each comma
print("Hello","World","Again")

#using escape charachters to print.A back slash is also used in file paths and could have a different meaning. 
# to avoid we can use double back slash.
print('i\'m 5')
#single quotes inside double quotes
print("i'm 5")
