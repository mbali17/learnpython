Modules are code that has been written by others and has been open sourced to 
be re-used by others.There are different ways of installing the modules but, the standard
way is to use pip.
to install a module using pip we can follow the syntax
	pip install module_name
well, you might run into 'pip' is not a recognised command and you would need to check if 
the variable has the entry for the pip program.

or 
 you could use the following website to download the binary and use pip to install it

python stores the installed modules in the <python_installation_directory>/lib/site-packages

lib folder consists of the standard libraries that are present in the default python installatio

lib/site-packages consists of the third party module.

when a module is imported it as though the code is present in the current file and reading
through them would give a great idea about the library itself.

when importing a module python searches the following location for the module
	1)Local directory where the program is running
	2)Lib folder where the standard libraries are present
	3)lib/site-packages where the third party modules are present,


NOTE about naming of the file.When naming a file in python make sure not to name it same 
as the files present in the library or site-packages because when python is asked to 
import a library it first checks the local director before checking the lib and site-packages
directory.
